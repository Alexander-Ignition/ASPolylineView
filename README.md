Drop-in replacement for MKPolylineView with more customisation options.

Currently it is very simple and only includes drawing a differently coloured
border around the line.

Can be used instead of MKPolylineView. Adds the border by default. To change
the colour supply the 'borderColor' property and the 'borderMultiplier'
controls the width of that border.
